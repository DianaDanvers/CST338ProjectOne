# CST338ProjectOne
Project One with 3 distinct classes
This project is to emulate the functionality of a university's database.  
In this program, the User can create a School, which holds three objects: Students, Courses, and Instructors.  
The User may perform: queries to info on all three objects, add Courses, assigned Instructors to Courses, and register Students for Courses.  
The queried info is explicitly calculating averages! Courses show Student averages, Students show average of all their Courses' scores.  
Student's Course scores may be updated, should they be enrolled in that Course. Courses may only be deleted when nobody is enrolled.  
Instructors are required to update the scores as well as know how many Students are enrolled in their Course(s).
<h4> AS WE DISCUSSED: Your test5 uses an Integer on putScore as (..., 50) rather than (..., 50.0) -> I've used Double
</h4>
